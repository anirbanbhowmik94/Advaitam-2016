2.This event requires simple class room ideas along with innovation that can make the solution as complicated and fascinating as possible. 
3.Contraption is all about making most complicated solution to a simple problem. 
4.This contraption is designed to pull students away from conventional problem solving and push them into the endless chaos of imagination and intuitive thought. 
5.Instead of just "solving" the problem, teams have to make the solution as complicated and as convoluted as possible.
TASK :
In first step glow the bulb and in last step open a folded flag and at the same time bulb should be off and "SAVE ELECTRICITY" is written in the flag. 
Note :
Max. Participants per team: 5 
Trials : 1 
Maximum DIMENSION of the contraption-6*6*4 (l*b*h) foot , 
Rules and Regulations :

2)If you want to change in your idea (after submission your report) at the time of performence(final round) then marks will be deducted. 
3)Time for setup -2hours 
4) Maximum 3 interventions are allowed, after that points will be deducted for each intervention. 
5)Minimum number of steps must be 15. 
* Note-Explanation must be clear and simple.eg. Chemicals reacts and burns matchstick energy conversion -chemical energy to heat energy 
Formula Used: 
A = Marks given for abstract, asthetic simplicity. out of 30 (Presenting style will beconsidered). 
B = for energy conversion, 10 points will be awarded. 
C = for each intervention 10 points will be deducted. 
D = 40 points for completion of task 
E = If the participants decide to take extra time after 2 hours, for every extra 15 minutes 10 points will be deducted. 
Total Points = [A+B+C+D+F+G]-[E+H] 
6) Following parameters will be considered for judging this factor- 
a) The quality, difficulty and the purposefulness of energy conversions in the arrangement. 
b) The quality, difficulty and the purposefulness of parallel steps if any contributing towards the final aim of the arrangement. 
c) Different/unique steps and energy conversions. 
d) Overall Flow: How easy is it to see and follow the sequence from the first through the last step . 
e) Points calculate as per formula .

The event has THREE rounds that test your Simulation & Analyzing skills.
Round 1:- This round is an aptitude test on the fundamentals of Aptitude, Reasoning & general Awareness questions. Marks will be given on the basis of no. of questions correctly answered. There is one-third negative making. Selected teams from this round will proceed to the next round.
Round 2:- Here the participant will be given story where every character in the story will be described with respect to electrical components' characteristics. The participant has to identify what these characters corresponds to in electrical elements. And then connect the identified elements in the particular sequence, as mentioned, on a bread board. And has to identify across which element the given LED bulb will glow. EXAMPLE:
Each character represents an electrical element. The behavior of the person corresponds to the element's characteristics. Using these as clues identify what each character is in electrical analogy. 
Character A: Doesn't think of the past. He thinks only of the future. 
Character B: Adopts and responds immediately to all situations. 
Character C: Doesn't like changes in life. 
Relate these clues to the elements' behavior and identify these characters. Then, connect these elements so that there is no current division between them on the given bread board. Now, identify across which element the LED will glow. (Provided with a variable dc supply) 
Round 3:- Here in the participants will be tested on their simulation skills. A circuit is given which they need to simulate using Software Multisim. The participants will have to race against time as they compete with one another to make the best possible circuit. The accuracy and approach in building the circuit is tested. External power source is provided by the Organizer. 
The best three teams will be awarded first, second and third positions.
RULES AND REGULATIONS:
Each team can consist of 2 members. 
A basic knowledge of circuits is required. 
The decision of organizers will be treated as final. 
JUDGING CRITERIA:- • There is 1/4th negative marking in first round. Here evaluation is based on the number of questions answered correctly and minus the negative marks obtained. 
• Round two is based on Performance results and time factor is also considered. 
• Round three is based on the simulation skill of the participant and the time taken by the participant.

CHEM-CEPTION
xxxx
Technical Event
xxxx
The event focusses on the various aspects of chemical engineering processes and ongoings. It can be a platform for those students who are less exposed to industries to get an insight into the common operations, sales and services, product information, maintainence, machinery etc. of which a chemical engineering student must be acquainted, hence making it preponderant for almost every student. The event will also take a holistic approach in introducing and testing the knowledge of an individual. This event is also not restricted to the students of chemical engineering and can intrigue the students of other branches like mechanical and production.
The event will be conducted in second rounds:
First round( written, objective type) – This preliminary round will basically test the students knowledge on general topics and industry, its products, services, branches, external and internal affairs etc. This will be a knock out round.
Second round – In the second round, the selected students from the first round will be shown some videos concerning the manufacturing processes and unit operations used by some types of industries somewhat pertaining to chemical engineering (like petroleum, steel ,plastics and polymer, paper etc) and objective type questions will follow each video. This will also be a knock out round.
